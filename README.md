# Go-Shop ‚Äî Microservices E-commerce Platform

Go-Shop is an open-source project that builds a fully functional e-commerce platform based on a microservices architecture. The entire system is developed in Go (Golang), applying modern technologies and software design patterns to ensure scalability, high performance, and maintainability.

The goal of Go-Shop goes beyond creating a real-world product ‚Äî it also serves as a reference architecture for the Go developer community, providing high-quality source code and documentation for those who want to learn and implement complex microservices systems in practical environments.

## üéØ Functional Requirements

- **User Management**: Auth (JWT), roles (*Seller, Customer, Shipper*), profile CRUD, multiple addresses  
- **Shop**: Shop CRUD, promotions management  
- **Product**: Product CRUD  
- **Cart**: Add/update/remove items, apply promotions, calculate total  
- **Order**: Create order from cart, view cart, manage order status  
- **Payment**: E-wallet handling, MoMo integration, payment history

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### üì¶ Backend
- **Language**: Go (Golang) `1.24+`  
- **Frameworks**: Gin (HTTP), gRPC (inter-service communication)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary storage), Redis (cache & rate limiting)  
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka (event-driven architecture)  
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  

### üèó Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose  
- **API Gateway**: Kong (routing)  
- **Monitoring & Tracing**: Jaeger (distributed tracing)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  

### üß∞ Development Tools
- **Package Management**: Go Modules, Go Workspaces  
- **Testing**: Testify (assertions), GoMock (mock objects)  
- **Code Quality**: golangci-lint
- **Load Testing**: k6 (performance and load testing)

### üóÑ Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice owns its own PostgreSQL database  
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async communication via Kafka with **Inbox/Outbox Pattern**  
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management (e.g., Order ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Payment)  
- **Data Consistency**: Achieved through eventual consistency  

### üîê Security & Cross-cutting Concerns
- **API Gateway**: Kong as unified entry point for all requests  
- **Authentication**: JWT, user context propagated via headers  
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced at service layer  
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing across REST & gRPC via OpenTelemetry + Jaeger
